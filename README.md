ActorJS
=======

ActorJS is a JavaScript framework which structures your code as actors that communicate via asynchronous JSON-RPC and publish-subscribe messaging.

With ActorJS, you define actor types as RequireJS modules, then fire JSON-RPC calls to instantiate them, call their methods,
subscribe to their publications, kill them, and so forth. You can even distribute your actors across Web Workers, giving you
the capability to offload CPU-intensive processes onto separate threads.

Find documentation and examples on the [project pages](http://actorjs.org).
