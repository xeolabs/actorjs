ActorJS
=======

ActorJS is a JavaScript framework which structures your code as actors that communicate via asynchronous JSON-RPC and publish-subscribe messaging.
With ActorJS, you define actor types as RequireJS modules, then fire JSON-RPC calls to instantiate them, call their methods, subscribe to their publications,
 kill them, and so forth. You can distribute your actors across Web Workers, or among multiple browser windows.
